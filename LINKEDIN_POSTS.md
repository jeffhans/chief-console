## 📝 POST #1: The Pain Point Story
**Scheduled:** January 6-7, 2025
**Theme:** The brutal reality of reactive support
**Goal:** Establish credibility with real data

### Copy (Ready to Post):

🔥 The Hidden Cost of Reactive Support

Last month, we analyzed 11 real production support cases for our CP4I environment.

The pattern was brutal:
• Day 1: "Something's broken"
• Day 2: Support asks for logs
• Day 3: Support asks for config files
• Day 4: Support asks for Java version
• Day 5: Root cause finally identified

Average resolution time: 4-6 days

The frustrating part?

70% of these issues had clear patterns that could have been caught BEFORE opening a support case.

Root causes were often simple:
→ Wrong ulimit setting
→ Tmpdir space exhausted
→ Java version mismatch
→ Configuration drift

This is why I'm excited about IBM Support Customer Day on January 21st.

The shift from "reactive firefighting to proactive foresight" isn't just marketing—it's desperately needed.

When you're managing mission-critical CP4I workloads (Event Streams, App Connect, MQ), waiting days for back-and-forth data collection isn't acceptable.

Topics I'm most interested in:
✅ AI-powered issue detection (before they impact operations)
✅ Predictive support capabilities
✅ Self-service diagnostics

If you're in the CP4I/integration space and tired of the reactive support cycle, this might be worth your time.

What's your biggest support frustration? Mine is definitely the data collection back-and-forth. 💬

**Image Suggestion:** Screenshot of a support case timeline or a simple graphic showing "4-6 days" timeline

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Ask a question at the end (their biggest frustration)
- Respond to all comments in first 2 hours
- Share personal experience when relevant

## 📝 POST #2: Data-Driven Angle
**Scheduled:** January 13-14, 2025
**Theme:** Technical insights from MustGather analysis
**Goal:** Demonstrate deep expertise

### Copy (Ready to Post):

```
📊 I analyzed IBM MustGather requirements across CP4I capabilities.

The results were eye-opening.

Here's what EVERY support case requires:

✅ Pod logs → Requested 100% of the time
✅ Java version → Needed in 6 of 11 cases
✅ ConfigMap details → Critical but hard to extract
✅ Timeline/change correlation → Almost never captured

Yet collecting this data typically requires:
→ 5-10 separate oc commands
→ Multiple back-and-forth requests with support
→ 3-5 days of delays

Real example:

Production outage with Global Cache (WXS):
• 500k claims backed up
• 5 days to diagnose
• Root cause: NPROC ulimit = 1024 (should be 32768)
• Fix time: 15 minutes

The diagnosis took 100x longer than the fix.

This is the classic "shift-left" opportunity.

If 70% of diagnostic data could be automatically captured and correlated, we'd move from reactive support to proactive troubleshooting.

This is exactly what IBM is focusing on at Support Customer Day (Jan 21):

"AI-driven capabilities that surface issues before they impact your operations"

For anyone managing CP4I/ACE/Event Streams environments:

→ How much time do you spend collecting diagnostic data?
→ How often could you have fixed the issue yourself with the right insights?

I'm attending to see if IBM's approach can close these gaps.

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Technical audience - encourage detailed discussion
- Share specific examples in comments
- Connect with others who comment

## 📝 POST #3: Shift-Left Success Story
**Scheduled:** January 15-16, 2025
**Theme:** The future state - proactive vs reactive
**Goal:** Paint the vision of what's possible

### Copy (Ready to Post):

```
💡 What if your system could tell you the problem AND the fix?

Real scenario from Q4:

🔴 Production outage: Global Cache failing
🔴 Impact: 500k claims backed up
⏱️ Time to root cause: 5 days
🎯 Actual cause: NPROC ulimit = 1024 (should be 32768)
⚡ Fix time: 15 minutes

The diagnosis took 5 days of back-and-forth with support.
The fix took 15 minutes once we knew what was wrong.

Now imagine this instead:

🤖 System detects:
   "CRITICAL: NPROC ulimit (1024) below recommended (32768)"
   "WXS catalog pods restarting due to process limits"
   "FIX: Run these commands..."

⏱️ Issue resolved: 30 minutes
📧 Support cases opened: 0

This is the shift-left opportunity.

From reactive firefighting → Proactive detection
From days of diagnosis → Minutes of self-service
From dependency on support → Self-sufficiency with guidance

This transformation is exactly what IBM Support Customer Day (Jan 21) is about:

"AI-driven detection that surfaces issues before they impact operations"

For teams running mission-critical CP4I workloads:

What percentage of your support cases are for issues you COULD have self-diagnosed with better visibility?

For me, it's at least 70%.

I'm joining to see IBM's roadmap for proactive detection and automated resolution.

## 📝 POST #4: Final Reminder (The Blend)

**Theme:** Last call - blend all themes with urgency
**Goal:** Final push for registrations, FOMO

⏰ TOMORROW: IBM Support Customer Day (and why I'm attending)

After analyzing 11 production support cases and reviewing IBM MustGather requirements across CP4I, three patterns became crystal clear:

1️⃣ The reactive support cycle is expensive
   → 4-6 days average resolution time
   → 70% spent on data collection, not diagnosis
   → Root causes often simple (config, limits, versions)

2️⃣ The data exists, but isn't captured proactively
   → Pod logs, Java versions, ConfigMaps
   → Timeline/change correlation
   → Resource limits and actual usage

3️⃣ The shift-left opportunity is MASSIVE
   → Real example: 5 days to diagnose, 15 minutes to fix
   → What if the system told us the problem AND the solution?
   → Support cases could drop by 60-70%

This is why I'm attending tomorrow's event.

IBM is previewing:
✅ AI-powered issue detection (before production impact)
✅ Automated diagnostic data collection
✅ Predictive support capabilities
✅ Next-generation support tools

For anyone managing CP4I workloads (Event Streams, App Connect, MQ, API Connect):

This could be the blueprint for transforming your support model from reactive to proactive.

The question isn't "Can we afford to attend?"

It's "Can we afford NOT to?" when support resolution time directly impacts our SLAs.

See you there. 👋
